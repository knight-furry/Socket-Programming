# Chat Between OS 
SocketProgramming and Multithreading concepts are used to implement the Chat between multiple OS  

## Prerequisites -

- By default port 143 should be free, or change the port number in the program accordingly  
  
# 1. OSChat
Python program to implement chatting between two OS.

## Usage -
- Run the python program in both the OS  
- Start Chatting!!
  
  
# 2. MultiRecieve
By default recvfrom() function doesn't support parallelism. So to achieve parallelism we can use Multithreading concept  

## Usage - 
- Send message from different Sender OS
- You can see that it can recieve message from multiple OS at a time i.e. Parallelism
